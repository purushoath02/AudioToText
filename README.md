## Abstract
We all as people consume some form of entertainment in our daily lives, whether it be watching movies or shows or just listening to music or podcasts.
Subtitles have been an integral part of media in many ways. Many people, if not all, use this service. They help us to understand and “hear” better in a way. Not only for us, but they are also of great help for people with hearing difficulties. It enables them to understand just as good as anyone else.
We aim to create a web application to generate subtitles by uploading media in the form of videos and/or audios. We plan to implement the latter with the help of Flask web development framework in Python along with UI integration HTML/CSS/JS.
